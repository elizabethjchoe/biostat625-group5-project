  abstract  = "Socioeconomic status (SES) has a measurable and significant
               effect on cardiovascular health. Biological, behavioral, and
               psychosocial risk factors prevalent in disadvantaged individuals
               accentuate the link between SES and cardiovascular disease
               (CVD). Four measures have been consistently associated with CVD
               in high-income countries: income level, educational attainment,
               employment status, and neighborhood socioeconomic factors. In
               addition, disparities based on sex have been shown in several
               studies. Interventions targeting patients with low SES have
               predominantly focused on modification of traditional CVD risk
               factors. Promising approaches are emerging that can be
               implemented on an individual, community, or population basis to
               reduce disparities in outcomes. Structured physical activity has
               demonstrated effectiveness in low-SES populations, and
               geomapping may be used to identify targets for large-scale
               programs. Task shifting, the redistribution of healthcare
               management from physician to nonphysician providers in an effort
               to improve access to health care, may have a role in select
               areas. Integration of SES into the traditional CVD risk
               prediction models may allow improved management of individuals
               with high risk, but cultural and regional differences in SES
               make generalized implementation challenging. Future research is
               required to better understand the underlying mechanisms of CVD
               risk that affect individuals of low SES and to determine
               effective interventions for patients with high risk. We review
               the current state of knowledge on the impact of SES on the
               incidence, treatment, and outcomes of CVD in high-income
               societies and suggest future research directions aimed at the
               elimination of these adverse factors, and the integration of
               measures of SES into the customization of cardiovascular
               treatment.",
